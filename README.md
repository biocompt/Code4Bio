## Configure Github Repository
#### 1. Initialize the repository
```bash
git init
```
#### 2. Create at least one file (e.g., README.md)
```bash
echo "# Project Name" > README.md
```
#### 3. Stage the file
```bash
git add README.md
```
#### 4. Make the initial commit
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
#### 5. Rename the default branch from 'master' to 'main'
```bash
git branch -m main
```
#### 6. Add the remote repository (adjust the URL to yours)
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:your-username/your-repo.git
```
#### 7. Push the 'main' branch to the remote and set upstream tracking
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

### Choose ONE of the following options:
```bash
git config --global pull.rebase false     # Default: merge
git config --global pull.rebase true      # Rebase
git config --global pull.ff only          # Fast-forward only
```
