# API Tools

This folder contains scripts and tutorials for accessing biomedical and clinical data from public APIs. The goal is to facilitate the integration of external data sources into bioinformatics workflows.

## Contents

- **Orphadata API**: Access rare disease information, including classifications and phenotypes, via the Orphanet database.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library
- Internet access

## Purpose

These tools aim to automate data retrieval for research, annotation, or integration into larger pipelines (e.g., drug repurposing, phenotype-based analysis).
